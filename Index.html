            When Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took over as the manager at Manchester United in 2018, his squad lacked leadership. He believed in young players, yet he had very few players in his ranks that were to lead the side. Playing for England and Leicester City, it was obvious that he had the ability to make sure others were doing their jobs. He is not afraid to bark orders at his teammates.
